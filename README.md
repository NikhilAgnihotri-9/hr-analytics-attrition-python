# Automated HR Analytics Report for Workforce Planning Using Python

## Problem Statement
Organizations often rely on static Excel reports to understand employee attrition and workforce distribution. This project automates HR data analysis using Python to generate actionable insights for decision-makers.

## Dataset
This project uses a publicly available HR dataset created by IBM data scientists, containing employee demographics, job details, compensation, and attrition information.

## Business Questions
1. Which departments have the highest employee count and attrition rate?
2. Is attrition correlated with salary, age, or tenure?
3. Which job roles are most at risk of attrition?
4. What is the average tenure by department?
5. What actions can HR take based on these insights?
